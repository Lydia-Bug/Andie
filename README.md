    The people who contributed to that task
    All the ways to access that feature (e.g. menu, toolbar, keyboard shortcut)
    How you went about testing that feature (this should be brief, say 2-3 lines, and say what tools you used and what cases you checked)
    Any known issues with the current implementation, 

For the more general features we'd also like some additional information:

    For the Toolbar and Keyboard Shortcuts, a brief discussion about how you decided what features to make accessible
    For Exception Handling and Error Avoidance a list of errors that you fixed and exceptions that you caught in the project generally (e.g. in File operations) not covered in the testing of the specific features you implemented
